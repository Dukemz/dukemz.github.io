    <p class="DIAG PROM">HEYY</p>
    <p class="DIAG PROM">guess who just made a breakthrough</p>
    <p class="DIAG DYS">:o? you?</p>
    <p class="DIAG PROM">Yeah!!</p>
    <p class="DIAG PROM">The locals were actually kind of right. The rocks <i>are</i> influenced by the soul. Or the mind? It's a bit hard to tell</p>
    <p class="DIAG PROM">I don't know how it even happened, but I was absentmindedly thinking about lunch during one of those experiments. Somehow when I blasted another one of those rocks, it floated through the gap in the shield I accidentally left open, and literally prodded repeatedly at my lunchbox</p>
    <p class="DIAG PROM">I was so confused but it's actually funny thinking about it now</p>
    <p class="DIAG PLEI">did someone say lunch</p>
    <p class="DIAG PROM">Pleione aren't you supposed to be in the workshop right now?</p>
    <p class="DIAG DYS">OH MY GOODNESS, that's huge!!!</p>
    <p class="DIAG DYS">the rocks being somewhat living-ish, not pleione being hungry</p>
    <p class="DIAG PROM">I don't think it's that they're alive, more that they just sort of… follow an intention or an order? I haven't done enough rigorous testing to see for sure</p>
    <p class="DIAG PROM">If I'm thinking about 'going up' when making one, they float up instead of just hovering there</p>
    <p class="DIAG PROM">This makes no sense but it's really cool. I wonder if we could make them do more advanced stuff. I can't wait to get back to it tomorrow.</p>
    <p class="DIAG PLEI">can we make them get lunch</p>
    <p class="DIAG PROM">Probably not.</p>
    <p class="DIAG DYS">pleione eat your greens pls, i know you dont like them but if you dont eat them you'll probably starve. well, we cant really starve but you'll probably feel really not good</p>
    <p class="DIAG PLEI">i do though! it's just the broccoli that's annoying. i'll get used to it eventually</p>
    <p class="DIAG PROM">You won't get used to it if you hardly ever eat it.</p>
    <p class="DIAG PLEI">itll just be more appealing one day im sure</p>
    <p class="DIAG PROM">No it won't</p>
    <p class="DIAG PLEI">:(</p>
