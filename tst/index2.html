<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To  reach  the Western Lands is to achieve freedom from fear.  Do
you free yourself from fear by cowering in your physical body for
eternity?   Your  body  is a boat to lay aside when you reach the
far shore, or sell it if you can find  a  fool...  it's  full  of
holes...it's full of holes.</p>
<p>I want to reach the Western Lands-- right in front of you, across
the bubbling brook.  It's a frozen sewer-- it's known as the Duad
remember?    All the filth and  horror,  fear hate,  disease  and
death of human history flows between you and the  Western  Lands.
Let  it  flow!   My cat Fletch stretches behind me on the bed.  A
tree like black lace against a gray sky.  A flash of joy.</p>
<p>How long does it take a man to learn that  he  does  not,  cannot
want what he "wants?"</p>
<p>You  have to be in Hell to see Heaven.  Glimpses from the Land of
the Dead, flashes of serene timeless joy, a Joy as old as suffering 
and despair.</p>
<p>The  old writer couldn't write anymore because he had reached the
end of words, the end of what can be done with words.  And  then?
"British  we  are, British we stay."  How long can one hang on in
Gibraltar, with the tapestries where mustached riders with scimitars  
hunt  tigers,  the  ivory  balls one inside the other, bare
seams showing, the long tearoom with mirrors on  both  sides  and
the  tired  fuchsia  and rubber plants, the shops selling English
marmalade and Fortnum & Mason's tea...clinging to their Rock like
the rock apes, clinging always to less and less.</p>
<p>In  Tangier the Parade Bar is closed.  Shadows are falling on the
mountain.</p>
<p>"Hurry up please.  It's <a href="#end">time</a>."</p>

<h2>The end is nigh...</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Rains of frogs, rivers of blood,
earthquakes, tidal waves, dogs and cats lying together, and...I have
finally updated my homepage.  Okay, the contents are still 99% the same
old boring crap, but at least the form is a little less eye-gougingly
1996-ish, and there are links to places where I actually, you know,
"generate content" as the kids call it these days.</p>
<p>If you're feeling nostalgic, you can always see the old version 
<a href='oldweb/'>here</a>.</p>
<p>Even worse, through the miracle of tape backups, obsessive-compulsive
digital packratting, and an unquenchable thirst for public
humiliation, you can still see my <i>original</i>,
horrible-background-using, &lt;blink&gt;-tag-abusing,
thrown together at 3am in a sleepless haze in the basement of the <a
href='http://splweb.bwh.harvard.edu/' target='njm' >SPL</a> in 1997 with <a
target='njm' href='http://www.softquad.com'>HoTMeTaL 1.0</a> homepage
<a
href='oldweb/oldindex.html'>here</a>.</p>
<p>And if by that point you aren't clawing your own eyes out in
horror, you can always gaze upon the <a href='oldweb/home.html'>single
worst piece of HTML I ever created</a>.  Note that I will not be
held responsible for your psychiatric or opthamologic bills.</p>
