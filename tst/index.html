<p>To  reach  the Western Lands is to achieve freedom from fear.  Do
you free yourself from fear by cowering in your physical body for
eternity?   Your  body  is a boat to lay aside when you reach the
far shore, or sell it if you can find  a  fool...  it's  full  of
holes...it's full of holes.</p>
<p>I want to reach the Western Lands-- right in front of you, across
the bubbling brook.  It's a frozen sewer-- it's known as the Duad
remember?    All the filth and  horror,  fear hate,  disease  and
death of human history flows between you and the  Western  Lands.
Let  it  flow!   My cat Fletch stretches behind me on the bed.  A
tree like black lace against a gray sky.  A flash of joy.</p>
<p>How long does it take a man to learn that  he  does  not,  cannot
want what he "wants?"</p>
<p>You  have to be in Hell to see Heaven.  Glimpses from the Land of
the Dead, flashes of serene timeless joy, a Joy as old as suffering 
and despair.</p>
<p>The  old writer couldn't write anymore because he had reached the
end of words, the end of what can be done with words.  And  then?
"British  we  are, British we stay."  How long can one hang on in
Gibraltar, with the tapestries where mustached riders with scimitars  
hunt  tigers,  the  ivory  balls one inside the other, bare
seams showing, the long tearoom with mirrors on  both  sides  and
the  tired  fuchsia  and rubber plants, the shops selling English
marmalade and Fortnum & Mason's tea...clinging to their Rock like
the rock apes, clinging always to less and less.</p>
<p>In  Tangier the Parade Bar is closed.  Shadows are falling on the
mountain.</p>
<p>"Hurry up please.  It's <a href="index2.html">time</a>."</p>
